        <h3>What is good governance?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>
                        The generic understanding of governance is the management
                        of resources and policy-making by means of exercising
                        authority (power).
                    </b>
            <br> In this sense, the term "governance" appears to be more and more used in order to denote a complex set of structures and processes (at the public as well as at the private level), which are generally associated with national administration. However, its definitions offer a rather broad horizon of interpretation: wherever we can find this term, its definition varies slightly. For instance, in the Report of the Commission on Global Governance
        </p>
        <b>
                    "Our Global Neighbourhood" (1995)
                    governance is defined as:
                    "Good governance" is a normative conception
                    of the values according to which the act of
                    governance
                    is realized, and the method by
                    which groups of social actors interact in a certain
                    social context.
                </b>
        <br> The lack of a generally accepted definition of the concept is compensated by the identification of principles that strengthen good governance in any society. The most often enlisted principles include: participation, rule of law, transparency of decisionmaking or openness, accountability, predictability or coherence, and effectiveness. The international donor community generally shares the view that these principles stand at the foundation of sustainable development.
        <b>
                    The first characteristic refers to equal participation
                    by all members of society as the key element
                    of good governance, with everyone having
                    a role in the process of decision-making.
                </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>
                    Secondly,
                    good governance implies the rule of law
                    maintained through the impartiality and effectiveness
                    of the legal system.
                </b>
        <br>
        <br> Rule of law also means the protection of human rights (particularly those of minorities), independent judiciary and impartial and incorruptible law enforcement agencies. The rule of law involves a variety of conditions, being strongly connected to good administration of justice, good legal framework, verified dispute mechanisms, equal access to justice, and the independence of judiciary workers (lawyers, judges).
        <p>
            <b>Good governance is also based on the transparency
                        of the decision-making process, which
                        ensures that information is freely available and
                        accessible to those involved or affected by the
                        decisions taken.
                    </b>
            <br> Transparency therefore means free access to information. Last, but not least, accountability and responsibility (of the institutions, just as much as of the civil society) are key requirements of good governance, with all of the participants in the political and economic processes being accountable for their decisions to each other.
        </p>


        <h3>Why is good governance important?</h3>

        <b>    Promotes community confidence</b>

        <p>
            People are more likely to have confidence in their local government if decisions are made in a transparent and accountable way. This helps people feel that local government will act in the community’s overall interest, regardless of differing opinions. It also encourages local governments to remember that they are acting on behalf of their community and helps them to understand the importance of having open and ethical processes which adhere to the law and stand up to scrutiny.

        </p>
        <b>Encourages elected members and council officers to be confident</b>

        <p>
            Elected members and council officers will feel better about their involvement in local government when good governance is practised. Councillors will be more confident that they are across the issues, that they can trust the advice they are given, that their views will be respected even if everyone doesn’t agree with them, and that the council chamber is a safe place for debate and decision making. Officers will feel more confident in providing frank and fearless advice which is acknowledged and respected by councillors.
        </p>

        <b>Leads to better decisions</b>

        <p>
            Decisions that are informed by good information and data, by stakeholder views, and by open and honest debate will generally reflect the broad interests of the community. This does not assume that everyone will think each decision is the right one. But members of the community are more likely to accept the outcomes if the process has been good, even if they don’t agree with the decision. They will also be less tempted to continue fighting or attempting to overturn the decision. So even the most difficult and controversial decisions are more likely to stick.
        </p>

        <b>Helps local government meet its legislative responsibilities</b>

        <p>
            If decision-making is open and able to followed by observers, it is more likely that local governments will comply with the relevant legal requirements. They will also be less likely to take shortcuts or bend the rules.
        </p>

        <b>Supports ethical decision making</b>

        <p>
            Good governance creates an environment where elected members and council officers ask themselves "what is the right thing to do?" when making decisions. Making choices and having to account for them in an open and transparent way encourages honest consideration of the choices facing those in the governance process. This is the case even when differing moral frameworks between individuals means that the answer to "what is the right thing to do" is not always the same.

        <h1><a id="Principle">Principle</a></h1>
        <p>This Guide to principles of good governance is one of high-level principles which reflects this diversity and is intended to supplement the Criteria. We hope that this will be useful to schemes, prospective schemes and the wide range of stakeholders with an interest in Ombudsman matters. Six principles have been identified and briefly defined. The Guide then goes on to a brief analysis of each, identifying the characteristics which distinguish that particular principle and which make it appropriate to the governance of an Ombudsman scheme, all the time bearing in mind that these principles are in fact interdependent.</p>

        <p>The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the principles of good governance, with ‘independence’ at the core, surrounded by four supporting principles, and ‘effectiveness’ surrounding them all.</p>

    <!--Div for the Concept-->
    <div>
        <h1><a id="Concept">Concept</a></h1>
        <p>In the last twenty years, the concepts of "governance" and "good governance" have become widely used in both the academic and donor communities. These two traditions have dissimilar conceptualisations. First, there is the academic approach, which focuses mainly on the study of the different ways in which power and authority relations are structured in a given society. Second, there is the donor community's approach, which puts emphasis on the role state structures play in ensuring social, economic and policy equity and accountability through open policy processes.
        </p>
        The concept of good governance emerged mainly because practices of bad governance, characterized by corruption, unaccountable governments and lack of respect for human rights, had become increasingly dangerous, and the need to intervene in such cases had become urgent. Good governance has become an important element of the political and economic agendas, and has meanwhile been better specified along with the proliferation of good practices that take the concept into consideration. Beyond entailing just multiparty elections, a judiciary and a parliament, which have been identified as primary components of Western-style democracies, good governance goes on to address several other central issues:
        <br>
        <br> "Universal protection of human rights; non-discriminatory laws; efficient, impartial and rapid judicial processes; transparent public agencies; accountability for decisions by public officials, devolution of resources and decision making to local levels from the capital; and meaningful participation by citizens in debating public policies and choices."
        <br>
        <p>
            A question of critical importance is how far can the concept actually go? The answer to this question can be found in practice rather than just in theory; although the focus is on the public sector, where capacity building is called upon in order to strengthen and develop the social and economic situation, the concept applies to the private sector and the civil society, as well. When talking about good governance, what is generally referred to is the ability to perform efficiently, effectively and responsively, guided by principles that are feasible and desirable at all levels of the society, not just at the political one. As noticed in research material, reports and studies on the subject, good governance is a notion that refers to, and is functional in, a number of domains, going from institutional development to non-state actors' involvement.

    <!--Div for the Practices-->
    <div>
        <h1><a id="Practices">Practices</a></h1>
        <p>Most Boards accept and practice basic conventions of board governance, such as establishing a Board charter, following accepted policies, and keeping accurate minutes. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) makes several more recommendations for effective leadership:</p>

        <b>Establish a Governance or Nominating Committee.</b>
        <p> This committee should is responsible for appointing members to the board and evaluating its effectiveness.</p>

        <b>Create independent leadership roles.</b>
        <p> While many organizations still allow their Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to act as Chairperson, the NACD recommends appointing an independent Chairperson. This promotes unbiased decision-making and a balance of power. Other leadership positions could also be established, such as a Co-chair, Treasurers, etc. to further balance power and build the capacity of the board’s members.</p>
        <b>Encourage members to help set meeting agendas.</b>
        <p> Input from all members of the board is imperative, but often important topics are never introduced. It’s important for members to be active in setting the agenda, so the topics they feel are important are given due consideration.</p>
        <b>Establish a three-tier evaluation process.</b>
        <p> In The Modern Board of Directors, we explain how a board’s responsibilities include evaluation of senior managers as well as the board’s own effectiveness. The NACD suggests adding a third layer – an evaluation process for individual directors. This will help ensure every member of the board is contributing equally.</p>
        <b>Access outside advice.</b>
        <p>Many boards decide to secure the services of an external party to build capacity or help solve a problem. Navigating this process can be tricky, but it is easier when both the independent directors and senior management feel involved in the selection process. It is not only managers that can benefit from consulting or other services– the Board itself may need guidance. Though it’s natural to feel defensive, board members need not see getting advice as a sign of weakness. In fact, it’s an opportunity for the entire organization to grow even stronger.</p>
        <b>  Link board member compensation to the organization’s success.</b>
        <p>In some boards, members receive a form of compensation for their service: a stipend, health benefits, or stock options. The NACD suggests that stock options are most effective because they tie the Director’s compensation to the organization’s success</p>
